PyDnD

Tools for D&D 3.5 DMs written in Python Gtk

If you don't have PyGTK, it's available for Linux and Windows: http://www.pygtk.org/index.html
Mac OS X users may struggle but it is possible get PyGTK. At present, I can't offer an assistance installing PyGTK for Mac.


Pydnd is a series of tools for DMs running D&D 3.5e games.
